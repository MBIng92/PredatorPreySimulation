# PredatorPreySimulation
Hello, this is my Java version of the Predator-Prey-Simulation. I created this program just for fun and I am not a software engineer.

I created it in Eclipse and used the Processing core for basic functions like displaying the window, colors, I/O and draw shapes. To run the simulation, you need the latest version of the Java Development Kit (see here: https://www.oracle.com/de/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html). The Java Runtime Environment 8 does not work!

For more informations about Processing, look here: https://processing.org/ Processing is Open Source Software. The PDE (Processing Development Environment) is released under the GNU GPL (General Public License). The export libraries (also known as 'core') are released under the GNU LGPL (Lesser General Public License).

If you detect any bugs, please contact me.

For importing the Predator-Prey-Simulation in your project, please consider the following. After importing the file-system "PredatorPrey" into your Project, you have to add the "core.jar" to your Build Path! You are not allowed to change the "core.jar" file (GNU LGPL). But you are welcome to add new functions in the other files.

The "Predator Prey Simulation.jar" file is the actual program.

Have fun!
